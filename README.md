This is a test task for JetBrains intership 

Before attempting to complete this task, C# and Unity were very new things for me. However, I love to learn, so it has been a fun experience.

Test Task -- Implemented

Bonus Task 1 -- Implemented

Bonus Task 2 -- TODO

So, essentially, this code checks for ScenesRoot and recursively goes into children, building a hierarchy. 
It then memorizes GUIDs and all CS files. Next, it checks if either the GUID of the script in m_script exists or if there's a field with the GUID of the script. 
The name of a field is the name of the variable in the corresponding m_script, and the name of the script is the type of variable in the corresponding m_script.
I hope I've understood the task correctly :)
